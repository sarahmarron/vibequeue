# Project VibeQueue

Our app is a full-stack web application that integrates a React frontend with a Django backend to support natural-language–driven music discovery and Spotify playback. Users authenticate via Spotify OAuth, submit free-form text prompts describing a desired musical vibe, and receive structured song suggestions generated by the OpenAI API, which are seamlessly played on the user's device. The backend processes prompts, stores returned song metadata in a database, resolves suggested tracks to Spotify track IDs via search endpoints, and queues playable tracks to the user’s active Spotify device. The frontend displays prompt results in real time, allows users to initiate playback directly through the application, and visualizes a user’s evolving music discovery journey by grouping recommendations into prompt-based “buckets” and highlighting connections formed by shared songs across searches.

-----
# Motivation
- Music discovery on Spotify and other services feels repetitive
- Listeners don’t have the ability to find music with more specific vibes
- We wanted a more interactive, conversational way to find music
- We let users describe a feeling, scene, or setting and then recommend songs
- Integration with existing streaming services (Spotify)

# Setup Guide 

Local setup guide to run the React frontend and Django backend (Requires OpenAI API key, Spotify Developer App permissions/setup, and Spotify premium)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the main repository to your machine, creating your own branch, and switching to that branch.

### 2. Python Environment and Backend Dependencies
#### a) Create a Python environment (only do once)
```bash
cd BackEnd-CS222
python -m venv .venv
```
#### b) Activate the environment (do this every time you run or work on the project)
On Windows
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
On Mac
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### c) To install the dependencies, run the first line, and when introducing new dependencies (like pip installing anything new), run the second line (this updates requirements.txt)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### 3. Starting the Django Backend server
- Open the address listed in the terminal and see what directories our server has
```bash
cd spotifyapp
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### 4. Node.js and Frontend Dependencies
#### Install Node.js and Verify the Installation
- Go to https://nodejs.org
- Install the LTS version and make sure to check "Add to Path"
- Then verify the installation in the VSCode terminal (may need to restart VSCode a few times, etc.)
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
### 5. Starting the React Frontend server
- This should open a window in your browser
```bash
cd FrontEnd-CS222
npm install
npm start
```
### 6. Adding OpenAI API key
- Create a .env file in
```bash
BackEnd-CS222/spotifyapp/
```
- With the following line and enter the key (saved in Slack)
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
```

### 7. Enabling Spotify Integration
- Request project lead to add email to existing Spotify developer project, or create a project on the Spotify developers webpage and put setup information in
```bash
BackEnd-CS222/spotifyapp/core/credentials.py
```
- This allows for OAuth to work so that you can playback on your own device
